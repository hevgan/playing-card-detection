# playing-card-detection

### This project was developed for a partial credit for [Gdansk University of Technology](https://pg.edu.pl/en/main-page) Artificial Intelligence course.

#### It was done using [YoloV3](https://viso.ai/deep-learning/yolov3-overview/) labeling tool, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) computer-vision library and [Darknet](https://pjreddie.com/darknet/) neural network.

### weights and config files can be found here: [G-drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bgPbzClxDVlcYeQ5IaC_Vz1ODzz1FwFy?usp=sharing)

##### The training was done by using free GPU provided by [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) platform. 

##### Cards used to create the dataset and train the neural network: [Bicycle Cards](https://bicyclecards.com/product/bicycle-blank-face-red)


##### some of the code was borrowed from [this lovely repository](https://github.com/spmallick/learnopencv/tree/master/ObjectDetection-YOLO)
